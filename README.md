In this project, I performed testing and comparison of standard and secure versions of popular network protocols using Wireshark. To do this, I analyzed the following ports:

FTP uses port 21, while FTPS operates on port 990.
Telnet uses port 23, while SSH operates on port 22.
The SMTP protocol operates on port 25, while SMTPS uses ports 465 and 587.
The POP3 protocol operates on port 110, while the secure version POP3S uses port 995.
The IMAP protocol operates on port 143, while the secure version IMAPS uses port 993.
I used Wireshark to capture network traffic and observe how data is transmitted through these protocols. While studying the secure versions of these protocols, I was able to see how they ensure the security of transmitted information through encryption and other technologies.

Additionally, I explored Wireshark's capabilities for decrypting encrypted connections when the appropriate TLS keys are available. This allowed me to better understand how to diagnose and analyze network traffic, as well as how secure protocols such as HTTPS, SMTPS, and IMAPS ensure the security of transmitted data.

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of how different protocols work and how important data protection is when transmitted over the internet.
